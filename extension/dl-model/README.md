# Deep Learning Model Extension Specification

- **Title: Deep Learning Model**
- **Identifier: dl-model**
- **Field Name Prefix: dlm**
- **Scope: Item**
- **Extension [Maturity Classification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v1.0.0-beta.2/extensions#extension-maturity): Proposal**

This document explains the fields of the STAC Deep Learning Model (dlm) Extension to a STAC Item. The main objective is to be able to build model collections that can be searched and that are containing enough information to be able to deploy an inference service. When Deep Learning models are trained using satellite imagery, it is important to track essential information if you want to make them searchable and reusable:
1. The input data origin and specifications
2. The model base transforms
3. The model output and its semantic interepretation 
4. The runtime environment to be able to run the model
5. The scientific references

## Item Properties

| Field Name     | Type                           | Description |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| dlm:data       | \[[Data Object](#data-object)] | This describe the EO data compatible with the model. |
| dlm:inputs       | \[[Inputs Object](#inputs-object)] | This describe the EO data compatible with the model . |
| dlm:architecture       | \[[Architecture Object](#architecture-object)] | This describe the EO data compatible with the model. |
| dlm:runtime       | \[[Runtime Object](#runtime-object)] | This describe the EO data compatible with the model. |
| dlm:outputs       | \[[Outputs Object](#outputs-object)] | This describe the EO data compatible with the model. |

In addition, fields from the following extensions must be imported in the item:
* the [Scientific Extension Specification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v1.0.0-beta.2/extensions/scientific/README.md) to describe publications.
* the [EO Extension Specification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v1.0.0-beta.2/extensions/eo/README.md) to describe eo data.
* the [Version Extension Specification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v1.0.0-beta.2/extensions/version/README.md) to define version tags.

### Data Object

| Field Name     | Type                           | Description |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| process_ level       | enum | Data processing level (L0= raw, L4= ARD). The levels are described by an enum. Important parameter because it can impact the apparent variability of the data. |
| dtype       | enum | Data type (uint8, uint16, etc.) enum based on numpy base types. Potentially important for data normalization and therefore pre-processing. |
| nodata_value       | integer | 'no data' value, may be relevant if the network should ignore this value. |
| number_of_bands       | integer | number of bands used by the model |
| useful_bands       | \[[Outputs Object](#outputs-object)] | describes only the relevant bands for the model, based on the [eo:bands](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/v1.0.0-beta.2/extensions/eo/README.md#band-object) object but indicates only the relevant bands. |
